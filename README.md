# Percolation threshold
Estimating the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
This repository contains the solution to the problem found [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php).
The program does not pass the backwash test yet but does fine in estimating the percolation threshold.
